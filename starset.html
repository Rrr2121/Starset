		<h2>About Starset</h2>
		<p>Starset is an American rock band from Salem, Ohio, formed by Dustin Bates in 2013.  and Bates takes the roles of lead singer and songwriter whilst also playing the keyboard. Bates' interest in Space was first fueled when acquiring his PhD in electrical engineering as he studied at Ohio University. He also has completed research for the U.S. Air Force and even taught at the International Space University.

		Starset is part of the group, The Starset Society, who are meant to help develop on the scientific and political themes of the bands music.</p>
		<h2>Music Style</h2>
		<p>Bates describes it as a "cinematic rock" - not very recognized genre. Describing with the band their first album Transmissions, he said: "as if a hard-rock band did soundtrack to an epic blockbuster movie...we're blending symphonics with electronics with riff-driven, baritone guitar hard rock."

		While talking about the second album Vessels he said: "now it goes more metal at times, using electronics at more deeply integrated level. Whereas the strings were more cinematic, there was more of a quartet before, on this record its more of an orchestration..."

		Bates also created for the band a fictional backstory, which is told through the music.

		In the backstory, Starset was formed as part of a public outreach initiative by The Starset Society. The Society's aim were to alert the public from about the contents of "the Message" the society obtained from a mysterious signal from space.</p>
